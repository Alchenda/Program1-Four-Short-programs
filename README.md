# Four Short C++ Programs
The project of this C++ program was conducted in a Data Structures and Algorithms course at the University of Massachusetts Lowell
Program 1: Four Short Programs (individual section names were “Painting a wall”, “Text message expander”, “Drawing a half arrow”, and “Authoring assistant”)
All of the code attached is in .cpp. All of the code simply needs to be compiled and then it is fine. If the executable is needed feel free to email me @ dwebbmcclain@gmail.com I can compile the executable for you.
